Feature: suite command
  As a user
  In order to interact with Solano
  I want to configure a test suite

Background:
  Given the command is "solano suite"

Scenario Outline: Configure new suite with test exclude pattern and string values in repo config file
  Given the user is logged in, and can successfully create a new suite in a git repo
  And a file named "config/<file name>" with:
  """
  ---
  <root section>
    test_pattern:
      - spec/controllers/**_spec.rb
      - features/api/**.feature
      - test/unit/**_test.rb
    test_exclude_pattern:
      - test/unit/skip_test.rb
  """
  When I run `solano suite` interactively
  Then "solano suite" output should contain "Looks like"
  Then "solano suite" output should contain "Detected branch test/foobar"
  And "solano suite" output should contain "Detected ruby"
  And "solano suite" output should contain "Configured test pattern from config/<file name>:"
  And "solano suite" output should contain "Configured test exclude pattern from config/<file name>:"
  And "solano suite" output should contain:
  """
   - spec/controllers/**_spec.rb
   - features/api/**.feature
   - test/unit/**_test.rb
  """
  And "solano suite" output should contain:
  """
   - test/unit/skip_test.rb
  """
  When I choose defaults for CI settings
  Then "solano suite" output should contain "Created suite"
  When the console session ends
  Then the exit status should be 0
  Examples:
    | file name     | root section |
    | tddium.yml    | :tddium:     |
    | solano.yml    | :solano:     |
    | solano.yml    |              |
    | predix-ci.yml |              |
